# Buzz Architecture Reference

Read only for the task routed here by [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). Commands and code paths below are relative to the repository root unless a command changes directory.

## Product Contract

Before planning or reviewing a non-trivial change:

1. Read [VISION.md](../../VISION.md).
2. Read the `VISION_*.md` documents relevant to the affected product surface.
3. Read the applicable guidance in [TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md) and any
   package-local `TESTING.md`.
4. Check that the proposed design advances, or at least does not contradict,
   that product intent. Call out any intentional tension explicitly.

Implementation describes the product today; the vision documents describe the
product it is becoming. A locally correct change can still be wrong if it works
against that direction. Scale validation to the change's risk and exercise the
real workflow for user-visible or integration behavior when practical; green CI
and runtime evidence answer different questions.

## Ecosystem

Buzz spans five repos. This one (`block/buzz`) is the OSS source for the relay, desktop, mobile, and CLI. The others handle internal builds and deployment:

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [block/buzz](https://github.com/block/buzz) | OSS source — relay, desktop app, mobile app, CLI, agent harness |
| [squareup/buzz-releases](https://github.com/squareup/buzz-releases) | Buildkite pipelines producing Block-signed macOS + iOS builds with `-block` desktop version suffix |
| [squareup/sprout-oss](https://github.com/squareup/sprout-oss) | CI pipeline building the relay Docker image and pushing to internal ECR |
| [squareup/block-coder-tf-stacks](https://github.com/squareup/block-coder-tf-stacks) | Terraform + ArgoCD deploying the relay to the staging Kubernetes cluster |
| [squareup/sprout-backend-blox](https://github.com/squareup/sprout-backend-blox) | Desktop backend provider script connecting Blox workstation agents to the relay |

```

## Key Patterns

**Nostr-first HTTP surface**: Buzz's primary API is NIP-29 over WebSocket. The relay also exposes a narrow HTTP surface: NIP-11/NIP-05 metadata, `POST /events`, `POST /query`, `POST /count`, workflow webhooks at `/hooks/{id}`, Blossom media, git smart HTTP, git policy hooks, and health probes. These HTTP paths all preserve the same host-derived community boundary.

**Prefer Nostr events over new HTTP endpoints**: For new feature work, model
the operation as a Nostr event (new kind in `buzz-core/src/kind.rs`, handler
in `buzz-relay`) rather than adding endpoint-specific JSON APIs. HTTP is
reserved for things that genuinely need an HTTP-only surface: media upload/download
(Blossom), webhooks, git smart HTTP, NIP-11/NIP-05 metadata, health checks,
and the generic Nostr bridge endpoints:

- `POST /events` — submit any signed event (same path the WebSocket uses).
- `POST /query` — Nostr REQ filters over HTTP. NIP-50 `search` filters
  are routed to `buzz-search` (Postgres FTS) automatically.
- `POST /count` — Nostr COUNT filters over HTTP.

If you find yourself reaching for a new HTTP endpoint, first check whether
an event kind would do the job — it usually will, and you get realtime
fan-out, NIP-29 scoping, and the existing auth pipeline for free.

Reference https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips

**Event kinds**: All event kind integers are defined in
`buzz-core/src/kind.rs`. New features get new kind integers — add them here
first, then implement handling in the relay.

**Channel scoping**: Channels use `h` tags (NIP-29 group tag), not `e` tags.
Filters and queries must scope to `h` tags when operating within a channel.
This applies to events *inside* a channel. Addressable events that describe a
channel carry its id in their `d` tag instead: kind:39000 (metadata),
kind:39001, kind:39002 (membership). `get_channels` resolves a user's channels
from the `d` tag of their kind:39002 events, not from `h`.

**Agent-facing operations go in `buzz-cli`**: New agent-facing features belong in `buzz-cli` — add a subcommand there first, then wire the REST/WebSocket call in `client.rs`. `buzz-dev-mcp` (shell + file tools for `buzz-agent`) is separate.

**Workflow conditions**: `buzz-workflow` uses
[evalexpr](https://docs.rs/evalexpr) for condition evaluation. Keep expressions
simple and testable.

**Thread counters**: `reply_count` and `descendant_count` are materialized on
thread root events. Any code that inserts replies must update these counters —
check existing reply handlers for the pattern.

## Agent CLI (`buzz-cli`)

`buzz` is the agent-first CLI. Auth env vars
(`BUZZ_RELAY_URL`, `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY`, `BUZZ_AUTH_TAG`) are auto-injected
by the ACP harness into managed agent subprocesses. In development, set
`BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` and `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` in your environment manually.

### Building the CLI

```bash
cargo build --release -p buzz-cli
```

Binary location: `./target/release/buzz`. Add `./target/release` to `PATH`
or invoke with the full path.

### Deep Links

`buzz://message?channel=<uuid>&id=<hex>` links reference a specific message
thread. To read the linked thread:

```bash
buzz --format compact messages thread --channel <uuid> --event <hex>
```

Extract `channel` and `id` from the URL query parameters. The optional
`thread` parameter (root event ID) can be ignored — `messages thread` resolves
the full thread from the event ID alone.

All reads return sig-stripped JSON arrays; all writes return
`{event_id, accepted, message}`; creates add the entity ID. Exit codes:
0=ok, 1=input error, 2=network/relay, 3=auth, 4=other, 5=write conflict (NIP-33 LWW).

`--format compact` is a **global** flag — it goes before the subcommand:
`buzz --format compact channels list`, NOT `buzz channels list --format compact`.

See `crates/buzz-cli/TESTING.md` for the full live-testing runbook.

## Common Gotchas

1. **Kind `39000` for channel metadata, not `41`** — kind 41 is NIP-01 (unused). All kinds defined in `buzz-core/src/kind.rs`.
2. **Relay queries must specify `kinds`** — omitting `kinds` triggers the p-gate (403). Always include explicit kind filters.
3. **`messages search` chooses its own supported kinds** — do not add a `--kinds` option; the current command does not accept one. This differs from raw relay filters, which still need explicit kinds.
4. **Worktrees: `cd` in the same command** — shell CWD doesn't persist between tool calls. Use `cd /path && cargo build` as one command.
5. **Desktop crate excluded from root workspace** — `cargo test` at repo root does NOT run desktop tests. Use `cargo test --manifest-path desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` explicitly.
6. **React render perf: `React.memo` is all-or-nothing** — it only skips a re-render when *every* prop is reference-stable; one unstable prop (inline arrow/JSX, or a hook returning a fresh `{}`/`[]`/`Map` each render) defeats it. Two repeat offenders: (a) React Query results (`useMutation`/`useQuery`) are a **new object each render** — depend on the stable method (`mutation.mutateAsync`), not the object; (b) derived `Map`/array state that recomputes on a version bump — wrap in a content-equality ref cache (`shared/hooks/useStableReference.ts`). When chasing interaction lag, **measure with DevTools closed and no perf probes** (an open Web Inspector + per-keystroke `console.log` inflate the numbers), and isolate by removing one suspect at a time rather than guessing.
